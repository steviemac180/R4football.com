This is a website made using the wonderful [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme).

The purpose of the website is to show a methodical process for analysing a commonly available dataset relating to football (soccer) using the R language.

All analysis is performed using R and displayed in rmarkdown via the blogdown package above.

I hope the content provides useful for readers, it certainly is for me building it
