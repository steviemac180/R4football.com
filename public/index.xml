      <description>This is the first post on this site actually dealing with looking at football data. The data used is freely available from football-data.co.uk. Having downloaded the data I will first load it into R and have the full data set loaded into my environment.The first few steps will be getting a feel for the data and what is contained within it.Before we proceed any further I will load the required packages from R into the session.</description>

      <description>This is a website for made using the wonderful blogdown package. The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie.
The purpose of the website is to show a methodical process for analysing a commonly available dataset relating to football (soccer) using the R language.
All analysis is performed using R and displayed in rmarkdown via the blogdown package above.
I hope the content provides useful for readers, it certainly is for me building it</description>
